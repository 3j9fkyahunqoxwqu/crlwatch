To get the project off of the ground, we need to do the following:
    1) We need to crawl the entire internet for leaf and CA certificates
    2) We need to generate a list of all CRLs discovered in the above survey
    3) We need to randomly select CRLs and fetch all of them (w/Tor) regularly
    4) We should parse each CRL and check the parsed and the raw CRL into git
    5) We should analyze the data over a period of time

Over time we need to repeat the first and second steps as often as is possible.
Steps three to five should be repeated on a daily basis with differences stored
in git or another document tracking system.
