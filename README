Do a bunch of stuff that you want to do regularly:

    make

Generate a full list of all known CRL files:

  parse-crl-list.py raw-crl-sql-output-list.txt \
                    |sort|uniq > master-crl-list.txt

Fetch all of the listed CRL files:

  fetch-crls.sh master-crl-list.txt

Parse and commit all CRL files:

  git-commit-crl-data.sh master-crl-list.txt

Parse a single CRL into text:

 parse-raw-crl-to-text.sh foo.crl
